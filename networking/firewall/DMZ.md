DMZ: Demilitarized Zone

### Security Zones
Three types of zone
1. Inside Zone
	- Trusted / Private
	- Private IP address
2. Outside Zone
	- Untrusted / Public
	- Internet
3. DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

- DMZ is a **perimeter network** that protects and adds an extra layer of security to an organization's internal local-area network from untrusted traffic
- End goal of DMZ is to allow an organization to access untrusted networks (internet), while ensuring its private network or LAN remain secure
- Organizations typically store external-facing services and resources, as well as servers for the Domain Name System (DNS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), mail, proxy, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and web servers, in the DMZ
